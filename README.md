IsTyping is a Snippet that can be plugged to an html input to perform action on different events.

For instance, it could be used to autosave a file via an ajax request when the user just modified the input. Or it could be use in a chat app to inform users that someone is typing a new message.

It use jquery, and this repo include a node.js app to serv the files(for test purpose).
